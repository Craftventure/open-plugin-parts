The Craftventure Plugin code

What does this include?
- Large portions of code. Basically took al Kotlin/Java files and combined it into a single directory. This means it's not a compilable project, as the only reason for release is to provide guidance towards those working on parks, and not to make your own bootleg Craftventure copy
- Removed some parts that I took from tutorials and other projects. For most part I put links on where to find this original code
- Removed parts of the config that would make it easier to copy Craftventure rides, as I don't want fake unpermitted Craftventure copies to arise and this should make that a bit harder
- All the secrets that Craftventure 2 held, from hidden achievements to sometimes forgotten simple things like Roller Coaster Day every year at the 16th of August
- Code from rides, karts, minigames and more
